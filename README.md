Hallo, unknown pals from the Internet, I'm Inwydix (not my real name, just my online alias, ty) 

I guess this is for me to talk about myself, so... I like to code, even tho I don't do it as much as I should or I would like. I'll use this as an excuse to do it more often and try to get better at it. I'll just try to share what I do in here, even if it ain't public, so I have some kind of "motivation" to do it regularly and get back some nice habits of mine, I hope you don't mind >.<

I'm currently learning... how to make multiplatform apps, I guess. Tho, I must say I kinda jump from what I should be doing to just things I want to do, so that might not be exactly what I'll do in here, but I'll try not to go too off-topic :no_mouth:

Tbh, I don't really think I'm prepared to collaborate on anything with anyone, but I could try, I guess, but only if you really want me to :worried:

On how you can reach me, I don't really like to talk to random people so I didn't really think about it yet... I guess I should... I'll update this once I've decided it :shrug:

BEFORE I FORGET, Spanish is my mother language so I might commit the mistakes while writting in English even tho I think I speak it fairly well. I can also understand and speak other languages, but I'm not as fluent or I don't consider them to be worldwide enough to be mentioned, so I will skip them and leave it just in English and Spanish. I'll probably redo this all later, right now I was just exploring around after doing some tests with the repositories, so don't mind me, I'm just writting the first things that come into my head while following the template example ._.

I guess that's all... if you are reading this by any chance, have a nice day/night :white_heart:
